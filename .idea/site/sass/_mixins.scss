//These are dry (don't repeat yourself) These are added to more than one element or class, so we can reuse these instead of saying them multiple times.
//You can refer to flexCenter to call these
@mixin flexCenter {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
//Use this for media queries later
@mixin mq($size) {
  @media only screen and (min-width: $size) {
    @content;
  }
}
